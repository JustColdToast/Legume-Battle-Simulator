# Legume-Battle-Simulator
is a small project I worked on, used to explore object-oriented programming in python, specifically classes and class inheritence.
It's inspired by turn-based creature battle games such as pokemon; using a system of custom built creatures which are one of three elemental types, in a battle system based around a rock-paper-scissors style elemental matching system.

###### Legume is currently being worked on, and it not in a playable state. So far creatures of Earth, Fire, and Water elements can be created, but the battle system is not yet fully implemented.
To test the program in it's current state an installation of a python interpretor is needed. Main.py is the file which houses the program, whereas all classes are located in the "Scripts" folder.
